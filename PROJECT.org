#+TITLE: "Roguebots" project
#+DESCRIPTION: Work progress, plans, ideas

* TODO Idea
*Roguebots* is a roguelike game with mechanics deeply inspired by [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(computer_game)][Robots]] game (aka "Gnome Robots", "Daleks", e.t.c). Player walks through the levels of giant tower to find & destroy the Mainframe - a mighty overmind of the Swarm of the Evil Robots. On each floor of the tower a hordes of robots will try to stop an invader, but wisdom and tactics, and also a couple tech gadgets will help you - a well-trained member of the anti-robot rebel - to complete the task and save the humanity!
* TODO View
** HUD
- powerups
- overal time
- teleport count
- level number
- some timers and gauges (boss health, fabric spawning rate)
- overal FOV for all robots if any walls present on level map (this make sence for stealth play style)
* IN-PROGRESS Gameplay
** Level generation
- simple rectangular rooms
- portals on the edges
  - one way portals
- walls and fences (robots can see through last ones bun not through the formes ones)
** Powerups
- original ones
  - random teleport
  - safe teleport
- stealth/visibility
  - invisibility
  - smoke grenades (for slealth)
  - holografic decoys
  - *scanner*
- weapons
  - mines (can kill the player, have some proximity range and damage range)
** Level goals and conditions
*** To complete level PC need to (one of?)
- eliminate all of the enemies
- defeate the boss
- find a key(s)
*** Question: exit portal vs auto teleport after the goal will be reached (classical)?
Exit portal can be useful, when PC will need to collect some powerups.
** mechanics
- robots must see the player to move to
- player must see the robots
  - player can have some sort of *scanner*, which shows all of then robots on the level if they are aggressive 
(see player and hunting him). Scanner do this by hacking of mainframe's alert network.
** TODO enemies
- simple robots, which
  - move straight to the player when see him,
  - kill him on collision,
  - die when collide with other robots, walls, etc 
- robots with limited range of possible directions to move to (moving only horizontally, vertically, ...)
- sleeping robots which sleep in the beginning, and wake up when PC moved near them (robots stays unseen until that)
- mine droppers
- robot fabrics
  - spawn the robots with constant rate
  - can be destroyed by other robots, mines, etc
