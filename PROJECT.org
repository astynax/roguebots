#+TITLE: "Roguebots" project
#+DESCRIPTION: Work progress, plans, ideas

* TODO Idea
*Roguebots* is a roguelike game with mechanics deeply inspired by [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(computer_game)][Robots]] game (aka "Gnome Robots", "Daleks", e.t.c). Player walks through the levels of giant tower to find & destroy the Mainframe - a mighty overmind of the Swarm of the Evil Robots. On each floor of the tower a hordes of robots will try to stop an invader, but wisdom and tactics, and also a couple tech gadgets will help you - a well-trained member of the anti-robot rebel - to complete the task and save the humanity!
* TODO View
** HUD
- powerups
- overal time
- teleport count
- level number
- some timers and gauges (boss health, fabric spawning rate)
- overal FOV for all robots if any walls present on level map (this make sence for stealth play style)
* IN-PROGRESS Gameplay
** level generation
- simple rectangular rooms
- portals on the edges
  - one way portals
- walls and fences (robots can see through last ones bun not through the formes ones)
** powerups
- random teleport
- safe teleport
- invisibility?
- mines (can kill the player, have some proximity range and damage range)
- smoke grenades (for slealth)
- holografic decoys
** level goals and conditions
*** To complete level PC need to (one of?)
- eliminate all of the enemies
- defeate the boss
- find a key(s)
*** exit portal vs auto teleport after the goal will be reached?
Exit portal can be useful, when PC will need to collect some powerups.
** mechanics
- limited FOV?
- limited LR scanner
** TODO enemies
- simple robots (die in first collision)
- robots with limited range of directions which them can use to move to
- robots which sleeps in the beginning, and wakes up when PC moved near them (robots stays unseen until that)
- mine droppers + landmines (with different ranges)
- robot fabrics (can be destroyed with collide robots, mines, etc)
